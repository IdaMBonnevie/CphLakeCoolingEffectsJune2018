# CphLakeCoolingEffectsJune2018
Python code to calculate local cooling effects from lakes examplified with calculations for Copenhagen 3rd of June 2018
# This Python code is provided free to reuse, just with the request of referencing this repository when reusing the code. 
# The script calculateLSTfinal.ipynb enables steps to calculate land surface temperature from Landsat-8 T1 band 4, band 5, and band 10. 
# The script final_lakes_analysis.ipynb enables analysis to: 
# 1. calculate local cooling effects near sea
# 2. calculate local cooling effects near lakes
# 3. calculate threshold value for lake size defined to be the minimum lake size for when all lakes demonstrate cooling effects.
# 4. estimating cooling effects from not yet located lakes to inform urban planning. 
# 5. to compare cooling effects from lakes and from Urban Atlas herbaceous vegetation associations.
